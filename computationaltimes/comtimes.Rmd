## How long it takes to generate a set of trees?

For 10 trees?

```{r}
library(dmea)
set.seed(128)
s = sim_phyl()
#plot(s$newick)
s2 = drop.fossil(s$newick)
s2 = phylo2p(s2)
wt = s2$t
n_trees = 100
pars = c(0.8,0.0175,0.1)
p = proc.time()
S = sim_srt(wt=wt, pars=pars, parallel=F, n_trees=n_trees)
print(proc.time()-p)
```

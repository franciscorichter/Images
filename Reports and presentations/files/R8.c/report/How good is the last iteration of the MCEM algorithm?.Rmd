In order to analyze the convergence of the proposed MCEM algorithm (add link) we perform the following experiment:

1. Simulate 1000 phylogenetic trees, calculate the complete-tree mle,  and drop extinct species
2. Reconstruct 100 trees for each observed tree simulated in 1. from the complete-tree mle parameter and calculate the MLE as described here (add link)

To visualize the results on the described simulation we plot, for each parameter, the value of the complete-tree MLE versus the MLE calculated on step 2.
